<p>I have decided to use code and JavaScript to showcase how many toppings I enjoy on pizza.  The prompt will hopefully allow you to input a number for the toppings and if that number is equal to or greater than the required amount that I enjoy it should declare the pizza ready to be eaten! </p>
<p>If the number is less than the amount I enjoy then it should declare that I do not want this pizza.</p>
